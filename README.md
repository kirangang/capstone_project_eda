# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

Welcome to the Hotel Booking Analysis project repository. This project focuses on exploring and analyzing data related to hotel bookings to gain insights and make data-driven decisions in the hospitality industry. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and how to use the code and data provided in this repository.

## Introduction

The hotel industry relies heavily on data-driven decision-making to optimize pricing, occupancy, and customer satisfaction. This project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about hotel bookings to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help hotels and stakeholders in the industry make more informed decisions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is `hotel_bookings.csv`. It includes information about hotel bookings, such as customer demographics, booking channels, reservation status, and more. 

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project include:

- **Data Exploration**: To gain a deep understanding of the dataset by performing EDA techniques.
- **Trend Identification**: To identify trends in booking patterns, seasonality, and customer behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: To create informative visualizations that convey insights effectively.
- **Recommendations**: To provide recommendations for hotels and industry stakeholders based on the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

To perform EDA, various data analysis techniques will be used, including but not limited to:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive Statistics
- Correlation Analysis

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Google Colab
- Pandas
